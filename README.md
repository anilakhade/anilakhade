# Hi, I'm Anil ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a trader learning programming to build tools related to finance â€”  
projects at the intersection of **markets and code**.  

## What I do now  
- Work as a derivatives trader in a family office in Delhi.  
- Manage â‚¹60â€“70 crore, mostly in index options (**NIFTY, BANKNIFTY**) & stock options.  
- Design strategies for **GOLD, SILVER, and CRUDEOIL** in MCX.  

## What I'm learning  
- Competitive programming (Codeforces, AtCoder) â€” pushing toward **Red Coder**.  
- Building trading tools with **Python (PySide6, pandas)**.  
- Developing an exchange simulator with **C++**.  
- Practicing Linux & terminal fluency (Arch+i3, nvim workflow).  

## My journey  
- 4+ years of derivatives trading (manual & algo) with platforms like NEST, XTS, and GREEK.  
- Transitioning into quantitative trading by coding my own tools.  
- Long-term ambition: blend trading experience with programming to work at world-class quant firms.  

## Current experiments  
- Portfolio risk dashboards in PySide6.  
- Backtesting engines for options strategies.  
- Daily CP challenges â€” logging solutions as part of the grind.  

## Tech I use  
- **Languages**: C++ (CP), Python (data/quant)  
- **Libraries/Tools**: pandas, PySide6, matplotlib, git  
- **Environment**: Arch Linux, nvim, bash, i3wm  

## Beyond code  
- Solid grounding in financial modeling and equity research.  
- Fascinated by micro & macro economics.  
- I enjoy interpreting FED, RBI, and government policies through a traderâ€™s lens.
